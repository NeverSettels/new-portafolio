      <h3>My background</h3>
      <p>
        I come from an Electrical engineering background and transitioned to the field of Web Development about a year
        ago. I recived my development education from two world class Prrogramming schools:
        <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/en/mexico-city">IronHack</a> and
        <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. Both programs focused not only on the proggraming skills
        necessary to be an effective programer but more importantly on the skill of learning and adptability to quickly
        learn the skills required to make an impact in the work place. I have a wide range of work place expirince from
        Freelance developer to Administrator of real estate operations

          <h3>Stand-up Guy</h3>
          <p>
            I like to do amateur stand-up comedy; I find it’s a cathartic way to relate to people and it is much cheaper
            than going to therapy.
